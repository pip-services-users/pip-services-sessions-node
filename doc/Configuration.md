## <a name="config"></a> Config

The **Config** section is used to set parameters for the microservice configurator component. 
In most cases this section is not used and can be omitted. The only situation where this is 
applicable is when a microservice configuration requires being loaded from a centralized configuration repository.

Example to retrieve microservice configuration remote repository by key 'pip-services-sessions':
```javascript
{
    "config": {
        "type": "remote",
        "transport": {
            "type": "rest",
            "host": "config.mydomain.com",
            "port": "8020"
        },
        "key": "pip-services-sessions" // Microservice config key
    } 
    ...
}
```

This is an optional section and can be omitted in the configuration.

[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#config)

## <a name="log"></a> Log

The **Log** section defines configuration of the microservice logger component. 
Based on the needs of the application,  logging can be configured to support different logging mechanisms:
- **null**: disable logging completely 
- **console**: log output to the console
- **file**: log output to a file
- **remote**: logs output to a centralized remote location.

The logging level is also configurable, which will allow output of more or less detailed logs.

Example to disable log:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "log": {
        "type": "null" // Disable log
    } 
    ...
}
```

Example to output detailed logs to console:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "log": {
        "type": "console",
        "level": 5  // All except trace
    } 
    ...
}
```
 
Example to send logs to remote logging server 
```javascript
{
    ...
    "log": {
        "type": "remote",
        "transport": {
            "type": "rest",
            "host": "log.mydomain.com",
            "port": "8021"
        },
        "level": 3 // Only fatal, error and warn
    } 
    ...
}
```

This is an optional section and can be omitted in the configuration.

[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#log)

## <a name="counters"></a> Counters

The **Counters** section defines configuration of the microservice performance counters component. 
Based on the needs of the application, performances counters can be configured to output to different locations:
- **null**: disable performance counters completely
- **log**: output performance counters to a log
- **remote**: output performance counters to a remote monitoring service

Example to disable counters:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "counters": {
        "type": "null" // Disable counters
    } 
    ...
}
```

Example to output counters to log:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "counters": {
        "type": "log"
    } 
    ...
}
```
 
Example to send performance metrics to remote server 
```javascript
{
    ...
    "counters": {
        "type": "remote",
        "transport": {
            "type": "rest",
            "host": "log.mydomain.com",
            "port": "8022"
        }
    } 
    ...
}
```

This is an optional section and can be omitted in the configuration.

[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#counters)

## <a name="db"></a> Db

The **Db** section defines configuration of the microservice data access component. The current microservices support 
two types of persistence: flat files or MongoDB. Flat files are great for development and testing, 
while MongoDB is a good option with outstanding performance and scalability, suitable for demanding production installations. 
You can choose and configure the option that suits your needs.

For more information on this section read 
[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#db)

### <a name="db_file"></a> File

Flat file persistence has the following configuration properties:
- type: 'file' - type that designates flat file persistence
- path: string - file path where UserSessions objects are stored. The object are written into the file in JSON format.
- data: [UserSessions] - (optional) array of UserSessions objects which is used to initialize the dataset. This option is only used in testing to set a known state on test start.

Example:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "db": {
        "type": "file",
        "path": "sessions.json",
        "data": []
    }
    ...
}
```

### <a name="db_mongodb"></a> MongoDB

MongoDB persistence has the following configuration properties:
- type: 'mongodb' - type that designates mongodb persistence
- uri: string - MongoDB connection uri formatted as: 'mongodb://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password&gt;]]&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;database&gt;' 
- options: object - (optional) MongoDB connection options. See: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html for more details.
- debug: boolean - (optional) Enables or disables connection debugging

Example:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "db": {
        "type": "mongodb",
        "uri": "mongodb://localhost/pipservicestest",
        "options": {
            "server": {
                "poolSize": 4,
                "socketOptions": {

                    "connectTimeoutMS": 5000
                },
                "auto_reconnect": true
            }
        },
        "debug": false        
    }
    ...
}
```

## <a name="deps"></a> Deps

The **Deps** section defines configuration of the client dependencies to external microservices. 
However, Sessions microservice doesn't have any dependencies. So, this section should be omitted entirely or kept empty.

This is an optional section and can be omitted in the configuration.

[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#deps)

## <a name="ctrl"></a> Ctrl

The **Ctrl** section defines configuration of the microservice business logic controller. 
Based on the needs of the application, this section gives the ability to replace 
the standard business logic controller with a custom implementation.

This is an optional section and can be omitted in the configuration.

For more information on this section read 
[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#ctrl)

## <a name="ints"></a> Ints

The Ints section defines configuration of custom interceptors to the microservice business logic. They decorate the controller 
and modify its behavior by intercepting calls before and after the invocation. 

This is an optional section and can be omitted in the configuration.

[Pip.Services Configuration Guide](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services-runtime-node/doc/Configuration.md#ints)

## <a name="api"></a> Api

The **Api** section defines configuration of the microservice services (also called endpoints) to provide API for the consumers. 
Each microservice can expose multiple APIs (HTTP/REST or Seneca) and multiple versions of the same API type.
At least one API service is required for the microservice to initialize successfully.

### <a name="api_rest"></a> Rest
